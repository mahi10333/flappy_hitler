# Project Statement

## Problem Statement

Many casual gamers and entertainment seekers want a simple, enjoyable game reminiscent of the classic Flappy Bird but with a unique and humorous theme. However, existing simple games often lack creative elements and engaging audiovisual feedback, making the experience less entertaining and repetitive. There is a need for a small, accessible game that offers quick, challenging gameplay with amusing graphics and sounds to keep players engaged.

## Scope of the Project

"Flappy Hitler vs. Stalin" is a lightweight desktop game built with Python and Pygame that delivers classic Flappy Bird mechanics but with a thematic twist featuring WWII figures as characters and obstacles. The game features smooth side-scrolling action, randomized pipe positions, score tracking, and immersive background music and sound effects. Upon game over, a comedic meme is displayed to add entertainment value.

## Target Users

- Casual gamers seeking quick, fun distraction games.
- Fans of simple arcade-style games with a humorous and unique theme.
- Beginners learning game development using Pygame.
- Users interested in retro-style games with modern sound and visual enhancements.

## High-Level Features

- Easy-to-understand gameplay with flap controls (spacebar) and score tracking.
- Dynamic obstacle generation with random gaps for replayability.
- Background music that plays during active gameplay for immersion.
- Sound effects and meme display upon collision to enhance the user experience.
- Clean and intuitive interface suitable for all ages.
- Quick restart functionality allowing seamless play sessions.

This project blends classic game design with modern multimedia content to offer a light-hearted, simple game experience for both players and developers wanting to explore Pygame basics and game mechanics.
