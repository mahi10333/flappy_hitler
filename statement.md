Problem Statement

Many casual players and those who want to be entertained wish for an easy, fun game with a classic style like Flappy Bird but with a unique and humorous theme. However, existing simple games often have a lack of creative elements in their design, along with a lack of interesting audiovisual feedback, making the experience less fun and repetitive. What's missing is a small, accessible game with quick, challenging gameplay that includes funny graphics and sounds to keep players engaged.

Project Scope

Flappy Hitler vs. Stalin is a lightweight desktop game created in Python with Pygame, offering classic Flappy Bird gameplay with a thematic twist: WWII figures as characters and obstacles. The game features smooth side-scrolling action, random positioning of the pipes, score tracking, and immersive background music with sound effects. A comedic meme is shown at game over for added entertainment.

## Target Users

- Casual gamers looking for fast, enjoyable distraction games.
- Anyone who likes arcade-style games, with a sense of humor and unique theme.
- Beginners learning game development using Pygame.

- Users looking for retro-style games with enhancements in sound and visuals.

High-Level Features
- Easy-to-understand gameplay: flap controlled with spacebar, showing the score.
Obstacles are generated dynamically with random gaps for replay value.
Background music played during the game to set the atmosphere.
Collision triggers a sound effect and/or displays a meme for the user.

Clean, intuitive interface that is appropriate for all ages. Quick restart functionality, allowing for seamless play sessions. This project merges classic design with the latest multimedia contents as a way to provide a light-hearted, simple game for players and developers who want to try out basic Pygame and game mechanics.
