Description:
-------------
This is a simple side-scrolling game built using Python and Pygame. The player controls "Flappy Hitler" (the bird) who must fly through gaps between pipes represented by images of "Joseph Stalin." The objective is to avoid collisions with pipes and screen edges while scoring points by passing through pipe pairs.

Features:
----------
- Smooth side-scrolling gameplay with gravity and flap controls (spacebar to flap).
- Pipes appear at regular intervals with randomized gap heights.
- Score increases each time the bird successfully passes a pipe gap.
- Background music plays during gameplay.
- Game over sound effect and a funny meme display upon collision.
- Restart the game by pressing any key after game over.
